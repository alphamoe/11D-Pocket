I would argue therefore that we should not get too distracted by the short term. Bill Gates also said that "Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years". 
```
```
Constantly seek feedback that supports or challenges that vision and evaluate it honestly. 
```
```
Founders and management teams take time to mature - developing the leadership and management skills. The very skills needed to create a team that is capable of not only surviving but thriving in the global marketplace.
```
```
Focus your technology on one or two key niches where you can compete immediately (e.g. you have the network, track record, less competitive landscape, etc…) and use that to win business that can fund the future development of your technology and product(s).
```
```
Stay open to inspiration - follow people, technologies, products and companies that inspire you, use lessons from these to identify and seek out opportunities and strategies for your organisation. 
```
```
Under the veneer of the “trivial” high-profile web and mobile app companies, incredible and relentless increases in computing hardware performance (processing power, storage, battery life, screen resolution, networking) are continuing. 
```
```
It is hard to predict the future, but as Alan Kay and others have stated: “the best way to predict the future is to invent it” - so in these disruptive times, your best opportunity for stability is to be disruptive.
```
```
Sometimes art imitates life and other times life imitates art - so always use your imagination to see a better future and work hard to invent on behalf of your customers to build it. And with the Human-carrying drone debuting at CES (Jan, 2016), we actually have flying cars now!
```
```
To summarise, the main lessons for me is are stay in business, keep abreast of technology development and seek new opportunities that align with your vision and continuously build them into your strategy. This can lead to significant success over 10 years that you could hardly have imagined at the beginning.

In April of this year, I finally felt ready to raise our A: we had just reached $100k in MRR, with low churn and a clear roadmap. I casually let one of these VCs know about it during a routine meeting. He instantly suggested we meet with his team more formally, and I knew I had now switched to “fundraising mode”. I spent 90% of my days working on the deck, gathering data, making projections and constantly iterating based on investor feedback.
```
```
I knew whoever would invest in our A round would become our first board member, and we’d have to work together for years. Considering you can’t really get rid of a board member, I felt it was important to start getting to know them early.

BitTorrent — the protocol — was a genius way to transmit large amounts of information over the net by breaking it into small chunks, sending it through a peer-to-peer network, and reassembling it.
```
```
Perhaps the lesson here is that sometimes technologies are not products. And they’re not companies. They’re just damn good technologies.
```
```
What’s more, to be successful, a startup requires both a great idea for a product or service, and a great idea for how to make money off of it. One without the other will fail.

I would encourage folks to compete with them to keep the web, the mobile web, and the Internet free and open. But I would not encourage those same folks to build paid services. I think their goals will be undermined by that choice.
```
```
Why do they show you that? Because most people prefer free to paid. I don't have the exact numbers but I would suspect less than 10% of Spotify's users pay for music. Why is Pandora so successful? Because it is free. Why is over the air radio still the most popular way to listen to music? Because it is free.
```
```
How well did they do? Phanfare charged to host photos. How well did they do? The list could go on and on but I don't want to focus on failed services.
```
```
Let's start with advertising. I do not believe it is evil. In fact, I believe it is a fantastic way to support services that want the broadest adoption and want to be free. Think about the Super Bowl, the World Cup, the Olympics, the Oscars, the Presidential Debates, the news coverage of important events. These things are ad supported and free for anyone to watch who has a TV and an antenna. It is good for society for these things to be available to the broadest audience.
```
```
Now let's look at servces where the users provide all the value. Wikipedia, Craigslist, YouTube, Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, WordPress, etc, etc. There is no value to any of these platforms if the users don't create the content. The users create the service, curate it, and make it what it is. I do not believe it makes sense to charge users to create the value.

The figure of the mad scientist, the eccentric genius, no longer belongs exclusively to Einstein. In the last two decades, the public fascination with the figure of Nikola Tesla has enlarged the myth to such an extent that it now exceeds the unquestionable achievements of this great Serbian inventor.

```
“When I came to America, I met Edison, and the effect that Edison produced upon me was rather extraordinary. I saw how this extraordinary man, who had had no training at all, did it all on his own. I felt mortified that I had squandered my life — you see I had studied a dozen languages and had delved in literature, reading anything that fell into my hands.”

In popular culture, Tesla is seen as an unsung hero whose merits were not sufficiently recognized.

“That undervalues how earth-shattering the iPhone was when it first came to market, and we all first got them and fell in love with them,” he says. “iPhone made the idea of a smartphone real. It really was a computer in your pocket. The idea of real internet, real web browser, MultiTouch. There were so many things that are core to what is the smartphone today, that created a product that customers fell in love with, that then also demanded more stuff on them, more apps.”
```
```
On the stage at the Moscone West hall in San Francisco, Apple’s CEO had just unveiled what would become the most transformative product since the PC.
```
```
“Some of the greatest innovations on iPhone over the last ten years have been in display. Displays are not going to go away. We still like to take pictures and we need to look at them, and a disembodied voice is not going to show me what the picture is.”
```
```
Not long after launch, Apple began implementing a system that opened the iPhone to a wide range of creators who would make countless apps. Apps that would amplify the iPhone’s impact.
```
```
“The quality is unmatched. The ease of use is still unmatched. The integration of hardware software is unmatched. We’re not about the cheapest, we’re not about the most, we’re about the best.”
```
```
In any case, the first iPhone decade has built a mind-boggling legacy. These are our digital protheses. We are cyborgs, appended to smart phones that give us power, and make us weaker when we for some reason don’t have one. No one knew this would happen, including Apple.
```
```
“When we started on iPhone, we could envision that phones would change forever and get better,” says Schiller. “We could envision that we could surf the web on them. We could envision that we could get our email. We could envision that it would replace our iPod one day. All those things we could see. But the magical thing that happened along the journey of iPhone is that it also became our most important device in our life. That transition in how we interact with the world is something that I don’t think anyone could completely understand, until we were living with these and using them.”

You can make the best cup of coffee in the world, but if you can’t sell it, you’re out of luck. Cash is oxygen. Money is what will take you to the next level, so if you can’t get it, you won’t move on. Be a good salesperson and curate your sales department with great care.

As search demand grew, websites developed content to meet that demand, which in turn further stoked demand.
```
```
Pull is when you are seeking information, usually an answer to a question. You want to know the closing time of a restaurant, the description of a hotel where you are thinking about staying, the details of an historical event you heard about, etc. You go to your computer and pull the information. The killer app for pulling information was Google.
```
```
The evolution of the internet is an extremely complex topic.
```
```
Push is when you are using the internet in a more passive way and content comes to you.
```
```
There will probably be a few big, successful companies that emerge from the push era. As in the pull era, the successful companies will reinforce the feedback loop: riding the trends instead of fighting them.

Too many people believe that speed is the enemy of quality. To an extent they’re right — you can’t force innovation and sometimes genius needs time and freedom to bloom. But in my experience, that’s the rare case. There’s not always a stark tradeoff between something done fast and done well.
```
```
All it takes is asking the simplest question: “Why can't this be done sooner?” Asking it methodically, reliably and habitually can have a profound impact on the speed of your organization.
```
```
Here he shares his tips for making speed fundamental to your company.
```
```
I believe that speed, like exercise and eating healthy, can be habitual.
```
```
Through a prolonged, proactive effort to develop these good habits, we can convert ourselves as founders, executives and employees to be faster, more efficient company-building machines. And, when enough members of a team exhibit this set of habits, and are rewarded with reinforcement, compensation, and promotions, the organization itself will gain velocity.

“Should we call our site something literal or should we make up a new word?”
```
```
At the very best, you end up defining a whole new category – Kleenex, Levis, Polaroids, Nikes, Ebay.  The downside to creating your own brand is that it is hard, and most of the time, very expensive and time consuming to hammer a new word into the consumer vocabulary.
```
```
Why?  The short answer is that when you successfully make up a new word and introduce it into everyday language, you own it.
```
```
On the other hand, if you’ve made up a brand new word, and have launched it into the marketplace, it is very likely that your awareness numbers are going to be low for a long time.

```
So, what does this mean for us consumers, how did we arrive here and where do we all go?
```
```
Soon you will be asking friends if they are part of the Google plan or perhaps the Amazon plan.
```
```
But now, in 2015, something new is happening. We all finally had the sober realization there must be a better way to monetize content beyond advertising
```
```
All of these internet giants smartly entered the market and established subscription bundles.
```
```
What is the second wave? The second wave is the idea that the internet goliaths of the world are now playing for the $150 or so we spend with the cable companies each month. 
```
```
This is the war. This is the new battle.Amazon quietly has established a truly awesome leadership position with Amazon Prime. Netflix has also figured out how to get 63 million people to shell out monthly at last count. And then there are internet giants still on the outside looking in. Through a series of misfirings, Google is noticeably behind the other players right now. YouTube responded to the war this year by releasing a confusing subscription YouTube product without offering any additional new premium content. Whoops.
```
```
It’s worth noting that all subscription offerings offer freebie content to get you in the door.
```
```
For larger content creators and aggregators, they need a reliable, steady business model after showing you so much great free content everyday.
```
```
The next wave of the web, the second wave, is essentially the post advertising web. Look at media business headlines in 2015, and they are all about subscription business models. Sure, they get called different names in different formats. In video, we call subscription offerings ‘over the top’ or for short, “OTT”. In print we call it the familiar– a membership or a subscription.
```
```
The second wave of the web is here.
```
```
More than anything, content on the web will grow up, and be forced to be much better than before. Look at our television choices now. Thanks to the second wave, we’re seeing the beginning of a television revolution. Look for this revolution to spread to other forms of content. We’ll also ask more from our news providers.

YouTube responded to the war this year by releasing a confusing subscription YouTube product without offering any additional new premium content. Whoops.
```
```
This is the war. This is the new battle.
```
```
It really boils down to one simple idea. Somebody has to pay for content. In the very early days of the web, the cost of content was forced on the platform or creator themselves. That sure didn’t last for long. We then tried advertisers. Even worse results. And now, in the second wave of the web, it’s us. The consumer will pay for content.
```
```
Here are some trends and developments to expect over the next twelve months:

If you looked at an entire roll of photos, most of them would be shit (red-eye, closed eyes, bad lighting), but we’d pick out the most flattering ones and plaster them on our doors, our walls, in picture frames. That’s how we signified fun and social connection before Facebook and Instagram were there to make it look prettier, with better lighting.

```
It is expected that most startups will fail, but that the best ones will provide enough returns to cover all the losses and then some.
```
```
The valuation is how much the company is worth. Determining this can get complicated, especially for early stage startups. Many startups raise funding when they are pre-revenue, so it’s really just a bet on how big the company could be someday.
```
```
Sadly, probably not. While some startups make billions of dollars, the majority of them fail. Smart, hard-working people with great ideas often run into challenges. It can be difficult to keep up with the pace of innovation, especially if a giant tech company decides to enter your field. But if you have a brilliant idea, don’t be discouraged. Just know that you’re taking a gamble.
```
```
However, if the startup goes bust, they don’t end up making money from the shares.
```
```
The money is used to accelerate growth. It is often used to hire new employees, sales & marketing efforts and any sort of production costs. It largely relates to the nature of their business.

While most publishers didn't have faith in them, they eventually got a publisher called Sierra Online to help distribute Half-Life.
```
```
Nevertheless, the reaction was stunning when the game was finally released and Half-Life would go on to become one of the best selling games of all time. 
```
```
In the world of gaming, we spend a lot of time talking about mobile gaming companies, big console manufacturers, traditional game publishers, or eSports.  However, one company that is not talked about enough is Seattle-based Valve, an organization that many in the tech industry know little about.
```
```
Nevertheless, the reaction was stunning when the game was finally released and Half-Life would go on to become one of the best selling games of all time. 
```
```
Valve was founded in 1996 by two longtime Microsoft employees, Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington.  After leaving Microsoft and securing a license to a game engine, Newell and Harrington embarked on their journey to create video games.
```
```
There was a ton of hype around the game and it was sure to be a hit, except for the fact that Gabe and his team decided that they wanted to revamp the entire game at the last minute.
```
```
Slated for release in November 2003, the unthinkable happened.  Valve was hacked and their source code was stolen.  A crude, unfinished version of the game spread across the Internet which demoralized the company and threw off their launch plans.
```
```
They ended up starting from scratch and overhauling the entire game, causing the release to get pushed multiple times, from early 1997 all the way to late 1998!
