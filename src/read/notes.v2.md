[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

> A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:
If applied, this commit will your subject line here

> Learn to love the command line. Leave the IDE behind.
For as many reasons as there are Git subcommands, it’s wise to embrace the command line. Git is insanely powerful; IDEs are too, but each in different ways. I use an IDE every day (IntelliJ IDEA) and have used others extensively (Eclipse), but I have never seen IDE integration for Git that could begin to match the ease and power of the command line (once you know it).

> Founding a company is hard. You’ve got an infinite number of decisions to make while simultaneously trying to catch lightning in a bottle with creating something out of nothing. It’s even harder when you’re doing it alone.

> Being a solo founder, in many ways, stacks the deck against you. 

> Let’s take a look at some of the benefits as well as drawbacks so you can figure out if being a solo founder is right for you. Then we’ll tackle some ways to make being a solo founder a pretty great thing.

> The cons of being a solo founder

* pros and cons: The pros and cons of something are its advantages and disadvantages, which you consider carefully so that you can make a sensible decision.

> But there are some significant caveats that can’t be ignored.

* caveat, warning, notice

> Don’t add a co-founder after the fact. This is one of the most unusual Silicon Valley practices to me. Adding a co-founder well after the company has started is just asking to have a misalignment of priorities.

> Have a community of other founders

> Your spouse/partner/significant other may be a great listener, but they won’t be able to empathize or offer much practical advice. Having a small community or mastermind of other founders is crucial when you’re a solo founder.

> Set your team on the right path and let them bear the weight along with you.

> Get out of the echo chamber

> It’s important to get out of the startup echo chamber. Get a hobby, read about things outside of the startup scene, make friends with people who have no ties to the tech world.

> You spend the majority of your time in your head and you’ve got to get out of it. It’s easy to let the loneliness and pressure take over, so you need to find an outlet for that.

> Maybe that’s talking to a therapist regularly. Maybe that’s meditation. Maybe it’s exercise. I run 3-4 times a week not only for physical benefits, but the mental as well.

> It’s crucial to take care of yourself as the top priority. Everything else trickles down from that.
