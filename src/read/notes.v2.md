[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

> A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:
If applied, this commit will your subject line here

> Learn to love the command line. Leave the IDE behind.
For as many reasons as there are Git subcommands, it’s wise to embrace the command line. Git is insanely powerful; IDEs are too, but each in different ways. I use an IDE every day (IntelliJ IDEA) and have used others extensively (Eclipse), but I have never seen IDE integration for Git that could begin to match the ease and power of the command line (once you know it).

[Being a Solo Founder: Pros, Cons, Tips & Tricks](https://baremetrics.com/blog/startup-solo-founder)

> Founding a company is hard. You’ve got an infinite number of decisions to make while simultaneously trying to catch lightning in a bottle with creating something out of nothing. It’s even harder when you’re doing it alone.

> Being a solo founder, in many ways, stacks the deck against you. 

> Let’s take a look at some of the benefits as well as drawbacks so you can figure out if being a solo founder is right for you. Then we’ll tackle some ways to make being a solo founder a pretty great thing.

> The cons of being a solo founder

* pros and cons: The pros and cons of something are its advantages and disadvantages, which you consider carefully so that you can make a sensible decision.

> But there are some significant caveats that can’t be ignored.

* caveat, warning, notice

> Don’t add a co-founder after the fact. This is one of the most unusual Silicon Valley practices to me. Adding a co-founder well after the company has started is just asking to have a misalignment of priorities.

> Have a community of other founders

> Your spouse/partner/significant other may be a great listener, but they won’t be able to empathize or offer much practical advice. Having a small community or mastermind of other founders is crucial when you’re a solo founder.

> Set your team on the right path and let them bear the weight along with you.

> Get out of the echo chamber

> It’s important to get out of the startup echo chamber. Get a hobby, read about things outside of the startup scene, make friends with people who have no ties to the tech world.

> You spend the majority of your time in your head and you’ve got to get out of it. It’s easy to let the loneliness and pressure take over, so you need to find an outlet for that.

> Maybe that’s talking to a therapist regularly. Maybe that’s meditation. Maybe it’s exercise. I run 3-4 times a week not only for physical benefits, but the mental as well.

> It’s crucial to take care of yourself as the top priority. Everything else trickles down from that.

* crucial, of great importance

> What are your thoughts on being a solo founder? Any tips for making it work? What’s your experience been like?

[Inspiring Women: Meet the Co-Founder of Winnie, a Yelp-Type App for Parents](http://www.livingly.com/Inspiring+Women/articles/nOLbwVFZVkv/Inspiring+Women+Meet+Co+Founder+Winnie+Yelp)

> Instead of throwing in the towel on her new company, she managed to navigate being a new CEO while caring for her young daughter and supporting her husband through his cancer fight.

> The good news is things are "much calmer now." Mauskopf's husband is cancer-free, they're about to celebrate their daughter's second birthday, and Winnie is now a community of over 25,000 parents. 

> Livingly: Why was it important for you to start Winnie?

> I needed to know everything from where to change my daughter’s diaper when I was out of the house to how to find the best local childcare to why the heck is my baby crying.

* diaper

> How has being a parent changed your career?

> I also think becoming a parent has made me a lot more confident. If I can create another human life and be responsible for its survival, then surely I can start a company!

> Don’t wait for the perfect time to follow your dreams. If you have an idea for something you want to exist in the world, go out and build it. Don’t wait for anyone to give you permission or the timing to be perfect. It turns out there’s never a perfect time.

> I used to think I got where I am because I’m a really hard worker but I have more recently come to realize an insane amount of privilege has gotten me to where I am today. Success takes hard work but I also had a wonderful upbringing, supportive parents, and a great education. It would be ridiculous to think that I could achieved even a quarter of what I’ve achieved without this incredible foundation.

* insane
* privilege

> The final thing that has gotten me to where I am today is my attitude. Life has not always gone my way, but it’s just made me more determined than ever to be successful. I have been knocked down too many times to count but I always seem to get back up and keep going, each time stronger than the last.

> How you treat people counts for so much so it’s really important you not only do good work but you’re someone who people want to work with.

> Did you ever want to throw in the towel?

* towel

> During this time, I was fortunate to have a lot of support from my family. Ironically, it was also Winnie too that was a big help to me, especially when I was acting as a solo parent for much of this time. 

> I had a lot of one on one time with my daughter so finding places I could take her was important to me. I needed to keep her out of the house for most of the weekend so my husband could rest (we have a small apartment) so I used Winnie often to find new playgrounds and museums we could explore.

> I used Winnie to find restaurants where we wouldn’t cause too much of a ruckus.

> What is the best part of your day? Arriving at the office is my favorite part of the day. I’m always so excited to get to work for the day and focus on making the world better for parents.

> At Livingly, our motto is "live life beautifully." What does living beautifully mean to you?

* motto

> Living beautifully means treasuring every day and enjoying even the smallest moments. 

> Cancer is a really ugly disease but it made me appreciate the beauty of being alive and being healthy and I will never take that for granted again.

[Sequoia's Investment Memo on YouTube by Roelof Botha](https://www.slideshare.net/zebs/sequoias-investment-memo-on-youtube)

> I learned of the YouTube service from a friend in roughly July 2005 and shortly thereafter began uploading personal videos that I had created to the service so that members of my family could view them.

> I saw YouTube as a next step in the evolution of user-generated content services, one that would allow ordinary users to express themselves to the world through the medium of video. I felt that the growth potential for such a platform was enormous given the rapid spread of personal video cameras and the growing availability of broadband Internet connectivity to ordinary consumers.

[Actions, not words, reveal our real values](https://sivers.org/arv)

> He said, “No, it’s not. Saying it doesn’t make it true.”

> He said, “I can ignore what you’re saying, and just look at your actions. Our actions always reveal our real values.”

> No matter what kind of stuff you tell the world, or tell yourself, your actions reveal your real values. Your actions show you what you actually want.

> I see two smart reactions to this:
1. Stop lying to yourself, and admit your real priorities.
2. Start doing what you say you want, and see if it’s really true.

> For example, I was procrastinating looking for alternatives after loosing my job, So I bought plane tickets to a trip where I'm likely to spend most of my savings. Now OF COURSE I am working hard! 

* procrastinate

[A challenge to startups](http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2015-12-18-startup-challenge.html)

> I started thinking about this a few days ago after re-reading an essay by Paul Graham and thinking about how lucky I was to be running a startup company now rather than two decades ago.

> In that essay, Paul remarked upon four developments which had made it cheaper than ever to launch a startup: Open Source Software, which dramatically reduced the cost of software (although as Jamie Zawinski famously pointed out, it only becomes free if your time has no value); Moore's Law, which dramatically reduced the cost of hardware; the Web, which made it possible to reach large audiences cheaply; and better programming languages (I would broaden this to software development tools generally) which made software development much faster. All of these remain very important ten years after Paul wrote that essay; while I think Paul somewhat overstated his case with the assertion that the Web made promotion free — the Web is now so packed full of better mousetraps that it's hard for the world to beat well-worn paths to every door — it's still startling to think about the effort which would be involved in marketing a social network, a hundred million item mail-order catalogue, of even a brand of mobile phones without the Web.

> There are no wrong answers here. 

> I have no doubt that his background will allow him to make important contributions there.

[AMAZON’S NEW CUSTOMER](https://stratechery.com/2017/amazons-new-customer/)

> This is particularly easy to grok in the case of Colligan and the iPhone: Apple’s goal was not to build a phone but to build an even more personal computer; their strategy was not to add on functionality to a phone but to reduce the phone to an app; and their tactics were not to duplicate the carriers but to leverage their connection with customers to gain concessions from them.

* grok
* tactic
* duplicate
* carrier

> Mackey’s misunderstanding was more subtle, and more profound: while the iPhone may be the most successful product of all time, Amazon and Jeff Bezos have their sights on being the most dominant company of all time. Start there, and this purchase makes all kinds of sense.

* subtle
* profound
